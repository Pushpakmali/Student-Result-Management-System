# Student-Result-Management-System
I have built a windows based appication called Student Result Management System in which their are 2 sections first is Admin
and second is Student.
In admin sectection I have provided a login functionality and only correct credentials is
allowed to acess the admin. In admin part I have provided 4 functionality where admin can add new student, see registered students, add marks of the registered students, and can view the data of students table and result table.
Also admin can logout and come back to the home page.
In student section I have provided the functionality to view the result of the perticular student using their course and roll no. If the roll no doesn't exist in both the tables(Student table and Result table) then we get a error msg that Roll No Or Couse is incoorect.
